README - Personal Profile Card

In this project, I created a personal profile card using HTML and CSS.

Types of CSS used:
1. Inline CSS – I used inline styling in the <section> tag to apply a background color.
2. Internal CSS – Inside the <style> tag in the head, I added some styles for headings, hobbies, and links.
3. External CSS – I linked a separate file named style.css where I added most of the styling like font family, colors, and layout for elements like .bio, .hobbies, .contact, and #profile-pic.

CSS Selectors used:
- Element selectors: h1, h2, body
- Class selectors: .bio, .hobbies, .contact
- ID selector: #profile-pic
- Grouping selector: h1, h2 (to style both together)
- Attribute selector: a[href] (to style links)

This assignment helped me understand how CSS can be used in different ways and how to apply selectors properly in a webpage.
